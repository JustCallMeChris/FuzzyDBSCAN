# This function executes fuzzy dbscan on a given set of data points.
# The algorithm is based on Fuzzy Core DBScan Clustering Algorithm by
# Gloria Bordogna and Dino Ienco. Based on means we adapted it as far
# as necessary to be intuitively what they might have meant in their paper
# with all the errors and lacks of information in it.
# 
# The resulting clustering is printed to standard out.
#
# Parameters are:
# eps:            epsilon distance
# minPtsMin:      minimum amount of points to be in the neighborhood of a
#                 data point p for p to be recognized as a core point.
# mintPtsMax:     maximum amount a points in the neighborhood of a data point
#                 which leads to maximum membership degree of 1 for points with
#                 at least minPtsMax neighbors. This parameter helps to recognize
#                 more degrees of density. Thats's why it is recommended to use
#                 big values.
# data:           String containing the path to an available arff file
#                 OR
#                 a numpy.ndarray with data points as rows and columns as attributes.
# createImage:    Boolean that tells the program to create an image of the resulting
#                 clustering in the operation system's temporary directory.
